Terms
	rmic 
		- RMI compiler
		- stubs and skeletons are generated from server class files by rmic
		- the names of the generated classes will be the original class name, appended with _Skel and _Stub.
	stub 
		- client-side object that 
		- repressents a single server object inside the client's JVM
		- implements same methods as the server object
		- maintains socket connection to server objedt's JVM
		- responsible for marshalling and demarshalling data on client side
	skeleton 
		- server side object
		- responsible for maintaining network connections
		- marshalling and dmearshalling data on server side
	marshalling and demarshalling 
		- the proces in which a client takes a request, including arguments and data and puts it into a format suitable for sending over a socket connection 
	remote objects 
		- remote objects are servers (fixed location, run a specific JVM on a particulaar computer somewhere in the network)
		- passed by REFERENCE
			- if two instances of remote object type exitst, they are logically DISTINCT
	serializable objects
		- objects whose locations is not relevant to their state
		- encapsulate data and are mobile (can be passed from one JVM to another)
		- passed by VALUE
	RMI registry 
		- the default naming service ships with Sun's JDK
		- java.rmi.Naming class have static methods for messages to the registry
	pass by
		- value 	- the caller and the callee have two indepenent variables with the same value. If the callee modifies the parameter variable, the effect is not visible to the caller.
		- reference - the caller and the callee use the same variale for the parameter. If the callee modifies the parameter variable, the effect is visible to the caller.
			int callerVariable=42;
			public void someMethodCall(int calleeVariable) {
				calleeVariable=99;
			}
			someMethodCall(callerVariable);
			// reference 	- callerVariable=99
			// value 		- callerVariable=42
