Shorthand Character Classes
	\s	- matches anything which is considered whitespace. This could be a space, tab, line break etc.
	\S	- matches the opposite of \s, that is anything which is not considered whitespace.
	\d	- matches anything which is considered a digit. ie 0 - 9 (It is effectively a shortcut for [0-9]).
	\D	- matches the opposite of \d, that is anything which is not considered a digit.
	\w	- matches anything which is considered a word character. That is [A-Za-z0-9_]. Note the inclusion of the underscore character '_'. 
	\W	- matches the opposite of \w, that is anything which is not considered a word character
	\t	- tab
	\n	- newline  (NL) or linefeed(LF), end-of-line (EOL), linebreak. The line feed function moved down a line.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline
	\r	- carriage return  (CR) The carriage return function moved the cursor from the end of the line to the beginning of the line. 
			Windows: 	\r\n (in that order)
			Mac:		\r
			Unix:		\n

Anchors
	^pattern	-matches the following pattern only at the beginning of the line 
	pattern$	-matches the preceding pattern only at the end of the line
					Example	^abc$	- matches abc pattern only if the whole line matches the pattern, eg. the line has only abc

Word boundaries
	A word is generally considered to be a string of characters that would be matched by the \w character class (that is, A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and _)
	\< 	- beginning of a word
	\>	- ending of a word
	\b	- either beginning or end of a word
			Input: goto Totoro tomato toto to
			Regex: \bto					to\b						\bto\b		to
			Match: tomato,toto, to		goto, tomato, toto, to	    to			goto, Totoro, tomato, toto, to
	\B - NOT beginning or end of word
			Input: goto Totoro tomato
			Regex: \Bto			to\b
			Match: Totoro		Totoro

Greedy vs. Lazy Matching
	greedy:	a.*d		xxabcdefghdxx > abcdefghd
		- try and find the largest string it can which matches the pattern
		- finds all possible matches, so it continues searching after founding abcd, until it founds abcdefghd, which is the last occurence that satisfies the pattern
	lazy:	a.*?d		xxabcdefghdxx > abcd
		- finds only the first possible match

Backreference
	Matches the results of a previous capture group
	\1			- backreference the first capture group
	\n			- backreference the n-th capture group
	input:		xax xab bab bax
	pattern: 	(\w)a\1
	result:		xax bab
	explain:	(\w)='x'				(\w)='b'
				\1='x'					\1='b'
				pattern: 'x''a''x'		'b''a''b'


Character Class
 	A "character class" matches only one out of several characters. [abc] matchers a or b or c

Metacharacters
	the backslash \
	the caret ^
	the dollar sign $
	the period or dot .
	the vertical bar or pipe symbol |
	the question mark ?
	the asterisk or star *
	the plus sign +
	the opening parenthesis (
	the closing parenthesis )
	the opening square bracket [
	and the opening curly brace {
