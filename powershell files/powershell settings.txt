Setup Powershell for VIM
1. Check & Set execution policy to run scripts
Get-ExecutionPolicy
	This will probably tell you itâ€™s restricted, in which case you need to tell it to run scripts by typing (or pasting):

2.  set execution policy (run PS in Administrator mode)
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

3. create a PowerShell profile (if it doesnt exist)
new-item -path $profile -itemtype file -force
4. Past the following to the PS profile:

	set-alias vim "C:/Program Files (x86)/Vim/Vim74/./vim.exe"

	# To edit the Powershell Profile
	# (Not that I'll remember this)
	Function Edit-Profile
	{
		vim $profile
	}

	# To edit Vim settings
	Function Edit-Vimrc
	{
		vim $HOME\_vimrc
	}
