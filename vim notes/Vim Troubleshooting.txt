vim diff error E97
	Workaround Remove shell=powershell and set shellcmnd=-c from vimrc. Gvim will use cmd as shell
	Error
		Error msg
			x86: The term 'x86' is not recognized as the name of cmdlet
		Possible cause
			powershell tries to run vim diff, but the path is wrong because of the space after C:\Program
		Command run
			powershell -c "C:\Program" Files (x86)\Vim\vim80\diff" -a ....
	Conditions
		diff.exe location is at $VIMRUNTIME (C:\Program" Files (x86)\Vim\vim80\)
		powershell is set for vim shell
	Not working attempts
	 	- set-alias diff <$VIMRUNTIME> because 'diff' is read-only term in powershell
		- updating the mydiff function in vimrc based on varios stackoverflow samples
			Source:
			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21862446/vimdiff-failing-with-cannot-read-or-write-temp-files	
		- running vim -V -d file1 file2 to determine problem
		- instead of simply setting shell=powershell tried to:
			set shell=C:\\WINDOWS\\sysnative\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe

Using GVIM as difftool instead of vim
	Solution
		Add Vim folder to PATH
		git config --global diff.tool gvimdiff
	Workaround
		If gvimdiff is available but didn't run for some reason, use:
		git difftool -t gvimdiff
	Problem
		git difftool starts vimdiff and not gvim
	Not working attempts
		try:
			>git config --global diff.tool gvimdiff
		result
			>git difftool
			The diff tool gvimdiff is not available as 'gvim'
		set-alias in powershell to start menu .lnk that runs gvim -d
		copy diff tool settings from here

	list available diff tool
		git difftool --tool-help

pathogen will not load bundles
	Problem
		After completing installation 
		to ~/vimfiles/autoload and downloading plugins to ~/vimfiles/bundle/pluginname
		the plugins are not loaded
	Root cause
		set encoding=UTF-8 in vimrc breaks plugins if the user folder name in Windows has accented characters
	Attempts
		Install Pathogen with Powershell:
			cd ~vimfiles
			Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://raw.github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/HEAD/autoload/pathogen.vim -Method Get -OutFile ~/vimfiles/autoload/pathogen.vim
			http://discoposse.com/2012/06/30/powershell-invoke-restmethod-putting-the-curl-in-your-shell/
		Install Nerdtree
			cd ~\vimfiles\bundle
			git clone git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
		Check runtimepath
			set rtp= shows ~/vimfiles/bundle/nerdtree
		add to _vimrc
			execute pathogen#infect()
			filetype plugin indent on
		move pathogen infect after/before vimrc_example.vim, mswin.vim sources
		add to _vimrc
			call pathogen#helptags() ” generate helptags for everything in ‘runtimepath’
			syntax on
	Workaround #1
		remove everything form _myvimrc
			It works. Now I have to find out what causes the problem
			Found it. UTF-8 encoding breaks if the user folder in Windows have accented character
	Fix CTRL-P plugin
		1. create c:\vimfiles\bundle
		2. move all plugins here
		3. update vimrc
			1. set pathogen#infect to the new location
				execute pathogen#infect("c:/vimfiles/bundle/{}")
			2. update runtimepath for ctrlp
				set runtimepath^=c:\vimfiles\bundle\ctrlp.vim

VIM automatically wraps lines after 78 characters
	Root cause:
		_vimrc imports vimrc_example.vim from $RUNTIME (VIM's install directory) and it overwrites the textwidth setting in vimrc
	Solution:
		Change in vimrc_example.vim the textwidth value to zero: 
		autocmd FileType text setlocal textwidth=0
