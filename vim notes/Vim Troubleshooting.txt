vim diff error E97
	Workaround
		Remove shell=powershell and set shellcmnd=-c from vimrc. Gvim will use cmd as shell
	Error
		Error msg
			x86: The term 'x86' is not recognized as the name of cmdlet
		Possible cause
			powershell tries to run vim diff, but the path is wrong because of the space after C:\Program
		Command run
			powershell -c "C:\Program" Files (x86)\Vim\vim80\diff" -a ....
	Conditions
		diff.exe location is at $VIMRUNTIME (C:\Program" Files (x86)\Vim\vim80\)
		powershell is set for vim shell
	Not working attempts
	 	- set-alias diff <$VIMRUNTIME> because 'diff' is read-only term in powershell
		- updating the mydiff function in vimrc based on varios stackoverflow samples
			Source:
			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21862446/vimdiff-failing-with-cannot-read-or-write-temp-files	
		- running vim -V -d file1 file2 to determine problem
		- instead of simply setting shell=powershell tried to:
			set shell=C:\\WINDOWS\\sysnative\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe

Using GVIM as difftool instead of vim
	Solution
		Add Vim folder to PATH
		git config --global diff.tool gvimdiff
	Workaround
		If gvimdiff is available but didn't run for some reason, use:
		git difftool -t gvimdiff
	Problem
		git difftool starts vimdiff and not gvim
	Not working attempts
		try:
			>git config --global diff.tool gvimdiff
		result
			>git difftool
			The diff tool gvimdiff is not available as 'gvim'
		set-alias in powershell to start menu .lnk that runs gvim -d
		copy diff tool settings from here

	list available diff tool
		git difftool --tool-help
