vim diff error E97
	Workaround
		Remove shell=powershell and set shellcmnd=-c from vimrc. Gvim will use cmd as shell
	Error
		Error msg
			x86: The term 'x86' is not recognized as the name of cmdlet
		Possible cause
			powershell tries to run vim diff, but the path is wrong because of the space after C:\Program
		Command run
			powershell -c "C:\Program" Files (x86)\Vim\vim80\diff" -a ....
	Conditions
		diff.exe location is at $VIMRUNTIME (C:\Program" Files (x86)\Vim\vim80\)
		powershell is set for vim shell
	Not working attempts
	 	- set-alias diff <$VIMRUNTIME> because 'diff' is read-only term in powershell
		- updating the mydiff function in vimrc based on varios stackoverflow samples

		- running vim -V -d file1 file2 to determine problem
		- instead of simply setting shell=powershell tried to:
			set shell=C:\\WINDOWS\\sysnative\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe
