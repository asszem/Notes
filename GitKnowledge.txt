****************KEYWORDS***********************
The HEAD
	HEAD is the pointer to the current branch reference, which is in turn a pointer to the last commit made on that branch. That means HEAD will be the parent of the next commit that is created. Itâ€™s generally simplest to think of HEAD as the snapshot of your last commit.
